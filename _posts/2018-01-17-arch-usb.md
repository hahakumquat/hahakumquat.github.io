I managed to mess up my USB installation medium tonight... managed to turn it into a NTFS, read-only USB, so I couldn't delete anything.

Since I just wanted to delete everything, I just wiped the drive using `parted`, downloaded the iso, and copied it using `dd`.

# Parted Wipe
```
parted \dev\sdb
(parted) mklabel gpt
(parted) mkpart 0% 100%
```

Then format:

```
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
```

Then download an iso from one of the online repositories. Suppose we place it in `~/archlinux.iso`. The command to copy the image onto the USB is:

```
sudo dd bs=4M if=~/archlinux.iso of=/dev/sdb status=progress oflag=sync
```

That's it!
