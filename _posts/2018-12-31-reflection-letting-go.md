I'm ending the year in the only way suitable for my 2018: slightly battered and bruised, but better for the most part as a result.

It wasn't just the last-minute wisdom teeth extraction a couple days back. Apart from the occasional urge to consume food that didn't immediately slide down my throat, the surgery actually wasn't that bad. 2018 put me through some pretty vivid situations, and honestly if I weren't such a bad writer, a full-length story about this year would be pretty funny. A bit sad, but probably funny overall. Thinking back, it's hard to pinpoint what exactly happened this past year that made it so impactful. Of course there were the major life events: graduation, family and relationship problems, employment, etc. But there were also these long periods of time where nothing in particular happened, though they changed me in ways I'm just beginning to realize. I don't know, I keep forgetting.

## I want to create a character that I love, and I want to kill it.

I'm a pretty decisive person when it comes to work-related things. Harvard has this tradition called "shopping week" where students have five days to try out and change their minds on which courses they want to take that semester. In all my time in college, I never walked into a semester without knowing which classes I'd take pretty much exactly. This semester, however, needed some second thinking. Big-dreamer boy me thought it would be a good idea to look into not one, not two, but three graduate level machine learning courses. After all, the previous semester's nonstop late nights grinding out math I barely understood was a rager, this semester would be killer!

But after four days of my eyes glazing over at the sight of notation, I turned to my friends for advice. Cecilia said I would be miserable. Richard said I would be miserable. And after thinking about it, they were right, I would be miserable. And in hindsight, they helped me make perhaps one of the most valuable decisions of my life.

It was a strange sensation, walking up Sever Hall's four flights of stairs to VES 153AR: Intermediate Animation. The walls morphed from the moldy oaky grime I had gotten to know through many weeks of painful sections for other courses into the modern, eerily metallic sheen of the Visual and Environmental Studies office. I peered into the classroom: an animation of scribbles and screaming greeted me. Definitely a different vibe from graduate-level optimization, but somehow refreshing.

There were interviews for the course. I wasn't sure what that entailed: I'd done my fair share of digital animations back in the day, but I'm certainly no traditional art prodigy. But when I walked in, I was greeted with a pleasant British woman. After some initial courteous banter, the questions began:

"Why do you want to take this course?"

"I've been 2D and 3D animating on and off for around 5 years now, producing for a variety of online video contests and courses, but I've never had the chance to create something for art's sake. I've been waiting for the opportunity to create an animation like this for as long as I can remember, and I think now is my last chance before I sell my soul to corporate tech."

"What do you want to create?"

"Hm...a few things. I want to create something beautiful. I want to create a character that I love, and I want to kill it. I want to tell a story about the Northern Lights. And I want a moth."

"One last question, more of a concern really. In this course, you won't be getting as much technical guidance as other students; I'm not familiar with 3D software, so you'd be on your own for any technical issues."

"That's fine, what I'm looking for from this course is time. All you have to do is give me the chance to sit in the corner of the room, and I'll make something cool for the class."

A few months later, I came out of the class with one of the most important artistic projects I've ever done. Toward the Light was not only a culmination of years of self-taught animation, but it also has become a way to come to terms with feelings of loss and change over the course of the year.

Since the completion of the animation, I haven't been able to bring myself back to digital art. I've tried here and there, but I've never felt the same excitement I did before. I thought the day this would happen would be a sad one, but after staring at screens all day for work, I'm okay with taking a break now.

## Yard Sale

I inadvertently started working for Facebook well before my first day on the job. My start date was September 4, but Mom and Dad were preparing early in the summer for their timely move to Michigan. Of course, over the course of twenty years of family life, you begin to accumulate a lot of stuff. Old furniture, outdated technology, and mountains of toys that served more as nostalgic mementos than as forms of entertainment. As the resident youngest child of the family, it became my job to figure out how to dispose of the excess.

Mom and Dad have an interesting relation with stuff. Mom is aggressively sentimental and Dad is extremely stingy. They are also adamant luddites. When I proposed the idea of selling our things on Facebook Marketplace, they initially met me with cries of concern. What if the customer was dangerous? What if they fail to deliver on the payment? Who would ever want this old kid's bed and frame?

It turns out that many good people are willing to pay a decent amount for that old kid's bed and frame. Before we knew it, decluttering became something of a miniature business on my future employer's platform. There was a certain thrill we got from exchanging something that would otherwise have been thrown away for some form of utility. I emphasize utility because, in some of the most valuable instances, the utility was indeed non-monetary. Sure, some sales reaped in some embarrassingly impressive cash flow. But some of the benefits were more sentimental. Perhaps the happiest moment was seeing the faces of children light up at the sight of free toys (with any sale of furniture valued at $20 or more). Most importantly, we were having a lot of fun tabulating how much we sold and taking stock of what else we could manage to sell.

In the beginning, there was some hesitation about losing our things. These pieces of furniture and toys were attached to priceless memories, and more often than I'd like to admit, it was painful to see some of our things go. But at the same time, through the sale of the object, my parents and I found a way to enjoy the object one last time, reflecting on our memories with it before passing it on to new loving hands. It was nice to see that in losing that which tied our family together, we were in turn brought a bit closer together.

We ended up earning a couple hundred bucks.

## Six Weeks of Solitude

Imagine being miles away from civilization in all directions yet at the same time equipped with all the necessary tools for survival. Welcome to corporate housing in Campbell, California.

By the end of July, Mom and Dad had kicked me out of the house early to prepare for their own move. This left me with an awkward six weeks between the day I made it to the Bay area and my start date at work. Fortunately, Facebook's relocation plan was generous enough to offer me one month of housing somewhere near the company. Unfortunately, the option they gave me was twenty miles away from the company and furthermore was smack dab in the middle of nowhere. Again, welcome to Campbell, California.

In almost any other situation, this would have been fine. But in this case, there were a few factors fighting against my success in Campbell, California:

1. With my new identity as an independent and temporarily unemployed bachelor, I decided early on to take on the philosophy of Zero Cost Living. As the name implies, Zero Cost Living is about removing accounting expenses from your life. These expenses include (but are not limited to) going out to see movies with friends, buying new clothing, paying for transportation, buying food, generally living like a decent human being and the like. With Zero Cost Living in mind, it was clear to me that the right play to stay home all day rather than go out and explore the town.

2. The apartment was nice. It was fully furnished, had a gym, pool, and business lounge, and even included free Netflix. Every week, maid service would come and clean the apartment. Again, it was clear to me that the right play was to stay home all day rather than go out and explore the town.

3. I had recently gone through a falling out with someone so I just wanted to stay at home all day and eat ice cream.

With no responsibilities or chores, you get really good at being busy for the sake of being busy. I read books and papers, exercised sometimes multiple times a day, made some interesting art, and learned to cook food that didn't taste like rubber. But as the weeks wore on, the allure of the unconstrained lifestyle wore off, and by the fifth day of watching The Office from dawn till dusk, these methods of blocking out and coping with my loneliness weren't working out.

I eventually got a car and escaped the house. I was getting lunch with a friend and she said to me:

"Sometimes, people have their own problems to deal with that have nothing to do with you. You have to realize that it's not your fault and that not everything is about you."

The apartment felt a lot less lonely after that.

## Roommate

Phillip is an interesting guy. We met in a hair salon near the end of senior year. The first thing that struck me was his remarkably pronounced jawline.

Before moving to the Bay area, I had made plans to live in San Francisco with a different college friend. But as I kept looking at the 2-hour commute to the office, the rampant homeless problem and sky-high real estate prices, there were fewer and fewer incentives pulling me toward the city.

One day in the midst of my housing crisis, Phillip messages me:

"Yo. Have you made housing plans? I'm looking for a roommate in South Bay."

And with that, I was deep into making housing plans in South Bay.

The night before I moved from corporate housing into my apartment, I get a text from Phillip.

"Don't freak out but I'm bleeding everywhere."

The glass shower door had gotten jammed while Phillip was trying to get out, and the door shattered all over him.

I arrive at the apartment the next morning. The shower looks like something straight out of a crime scene. The movers arrive shortly after, and one of them asks, "Wow, who died in here?"

I was looking for Phillip's dead body, but he told me he'd gone straight to work after staying at the hospital overnight.

Phillip is all about making optimal choices. He's thought through every permutation of personal finances you can think of, saving whopping pennies on every dollar. He's gone to work regardless of his physical state to ensure he was maximizing his potential productivity. When choosing teams, he spent weeks sitting with a team that seemed ideal but ended up not having headcount, followed by many more weeks sitting with two other teams before choosing his favorite.

Despite all the planning, Phillip had a rough year. Shortly after buying a bike he spent weeks deliberating on, Phillip failed to lock his bike to our apartment's bike rack and got it stolen. After the shower incident, Phillip spent months rehabilitating the cavity of meat carved out of his thumb by a shard of glass. I won't get started on work, finances and the various other medical maladies that Phillip was lucky enough to experience, but believe me, that was all pretty rough for Phillip.

Nevertheless, Phillip has been a good roommate. He's always happy and agreeable, making some poorly timed joke during my many stressful late nights coding in my room. He quickly ascribed to my philosophy of Zero Cost Living, and we've managed to cut out food expenses from our lives by cooking our infamous FB Stew on the weekends. Phillip even lets me pummel him through several of other streams of pain: Smash Melee, my emotional needs, weird forms of humor.

If there's one thing I can count on in life, it's that if I'm ever having a rough time, Phillip is probably smiling his way through something way worse. Phillip's great, go out and get yourself a Phillip.

## Unblocked

I knew which team I wanted to join before I even started working. It was a pretty easy question to answer: I wanted to do something that involved machine learning, and I wanted to do it in a language that was generalizable to other companies and projects. So, when I saw that I could work with PyTorch on a team doing topic classification, I was pretty much set. After the first meeting, the question I had was not whether I'd want to join, but rather when. I was enamored by the concept of the academic software engineer, the team easily fulfilled this fantasy, and in the grand scheme of things, if I ever felt like it wasn't working out and I needed to switch, that was fine too.

But work didn't let up, and there was one particular bug that plagued me for more weeks than I'd like to admit. It certainly wasn't an easy bug to catch in regular circumstances, but given the framework I was working in and the lack of resources and knowledgeable people about the codebase, it was much harder than it could've been.

When you're stuck on an issue for weeks and you've scoured all the documentation and employee directory for information, what is the right course of action? Whatever it was, it probably wasn't to continue bashing at it. I kept at it anyway and eventually figured it out, but being alone with problems is much, much worse than without.

On my first day at work, I met someone out of the blue. She played the guzheng, sported a boyish hairstyle, and was a budding practitioner of buddhist philosophy, mindfulness, and general spirituality. We kept in touch as I slowly began to lose control of my life.

There wasn't anything in particular she did that helped me out of my situation. She isn't a programmer and doesn't know a thing about machine learning, but when it feels like the sky is falling and you're not sure where to turn to next, empathy goes a long way. I've come to learn an immense amount from her about patience, kindness, and compassion, things you wouldn't typically learn on the job.

By the end of the half, I was beginning to think I wouldn't be able to find the bug. Now days, I don't feel like it would have mattered.

## Moving On

"I can't tell you her last name, that'll make it too easy to find her," my friend Amy says to me after suggesting we date. Here I am, reeling from the pain of a recent breakup and desiring nothing more than to focus on my work over my personal life. I thought nothing more of it and continued on with my life.

On October 1, after a particularly unproductive weekend, I hosted a little pottery painting get-together and posted in a social events group. An hour before the event, someone messages me:

"Hi! Is there room for one more? Can I come late?"

The first name is familiar. I take a look at our mutual friends; there's Amy.

"OMG YOU'RE AMY'S FRIEND. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DATE"

"OMG YOU'RE HARVARD GUY?"

A couple breakfasts later, we were more or less dating. Amy likes to take credit for settings us up; while I agree that having a mutual friend helped, I still stand by the fact that giving me a first name does not constitute setting anybody up.

It hasn't been the easiest experience at times. She's very independent; I'm very needy. And for dealing with all my little annoyances so far, I can't thank her enough. I'm a lot less worried about dating these days; where it goes, we'll see, but in any case, I think we'll all be happy in the end.

As I look back on 2018, I spent too much time focusing on growth and excellence in terms of skill and intelligence, when I should have focused on accepting and coping with the problems that were out of my control. All the issues and misdeeds, the stress, the loneliness and loss, it's all just a natural part of life. In 2019, I look forward to seeing the world through a different lens; not one where every day is an opportunity to do as much as I can, but rather as an opportunity to take a step back and enjoy living for life's sake. Because at the end of the day, after all ambition and drive, there is nothing better than to just let go.


And I'll learn some more Chinese. Here's all I got so far:
Chu he re dang wu
Hang di he xia tu
Shui zhi pan zhong can
Li li jie xin ku
